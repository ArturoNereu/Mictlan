# Mictlan
Repository for preservation of Phyne Game's 2011 game Mictlan.

As the game was released on Windows Phone (7 and 8), right now is not possible to play again. While I tried to convert it to Unity a couple of years ago, I found that there was no really a point as assets were created with a small resolution in mind. But as an exercise of preserving at least the visuales, here are the game's sprites used as they were used in the game.

Feel Free to use them for prototypes, articles, reference, etc. Attribution is not needed but is appreciated.
